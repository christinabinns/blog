title: dogs are cute
---

Dogs are generally cute and fluffy.

Some are big and some are small and some are in the middle. Some are soft and some are wirey and some are active and some are not. But they all are cute and a worthy animal to be man's best friend

Also they are warm and cuddly and full of fun
